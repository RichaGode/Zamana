        <h5>
        Club Zamana is the largest undergraduate South Asian organization at Columbia University, and a functional umbrella for the South Asian groups on campus. 
        We cater to over 800 general body members and strive to foster harmony, promote cultural awareness, and highlight the South Asian presence at Columbia. 
        In May 2008, Zamana was awarded the King's Crown Intergroup Award, to recognize its efforts in bringing together the South Asian community and its prominent groups. 
        Zamana was founded in the 1970's as the Indian Students Association, the present name was adopted in 1987 in order to better represent the growing diversity of the South Asian population. 
        Within the university, Zamana is recognized by both Columbia and Barnard student activity organizations and has ties with several academic and community leaders in the area. 
        Throughout the year, we hold a wide range of events for our members and the community. These events range from political forums, movie nights, community service days, semi formals, career panels, and educational activities. 
        In the spring semester, Zamana puts on Columbia University's largest cultural show, Tamasha, featuring performances from all Columbia South Asian dance troupes at Columbia, other student performances, and outside acts.
